    "description": "This was the final project for my BSc degree in Computer Science.<br/> The project involved creating an app for <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://mainmanager.com/\">MainManager</a> that makes it easier for users to notify local authorites or other official institutions of a problem, without knowing who should be notified. The user can mark a location on a map, choose a category and send a notification on something that needs fixing. That notification is then automatically sent to the proper authority.",
